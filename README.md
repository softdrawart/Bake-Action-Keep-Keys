# Bake-Action-Keep-Keys
This addon bakes animation from Source Action to Target Action keeping all the Target Action keys without adding new ones

1. Select Source Action that has animation that you want to copy poses from (its important that this action is not Blending set to 'Replace')

2. Select the Target Action, this is where the animation is baked (I recomend to duplicate original Action to keep it as a back up)

You can see that Typical bake in Blender bakes each 'n-th' keyframe so you have a lot of keyframes, while this addon bake helps preserve keys that you already have in the action, without adding new one, that helps you to work on your animation later!
